## Changing the Ollama Model

OllamaUI lets you switch between different Ollama LLM models easily without changing any code.

**How to change the model:**

1. Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

2. Locate the property:  
   ```
   spring.ai.ollama.chat.model=llama3
   ```

3. Change the value (`llama3`) to any supported Ollama model you want to use, for example:  
   ```
   spring.ai.ollama.chat.model=llama2
   ```

4. Save the file.

5. Restart the Spring Boot application to apply the new model:  
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The app will now use the updated model for all chat interactions.
